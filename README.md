## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
sshm
```

### Key Bindings

#### Main Menu
- `‚Üë/‚Üì`: Navigate through connections and groups
- `Enter`: Select/Open group or connection
- `c`: Connect to selected server via SSH
- `s`: Connect to selected server via SFTP
- `a`: Add new connection
- `e`: Edit selected connection
- `d`: Delete selected connection
- `q`: Quit application

#### Connection Form
- `‚Üë/‚Üì`: Navigate through fields
- `Enter`: Save connection
- `Esc`: Cancel and return to main menu
- `Ctrl+T`: Toggle password visibility (when in password field)

### Connection Configuration

When adding or editing a connection, you can configure:
- Name: Custom name for the connection
- Host: Server hostname or IP address
- Port: SSH port (default: 22)
- Username: SSH username
- Password: SSH password (optional)
- Key Path: Path to SSH private key (optional)
- Group: Hierarchical group path (e.g., "production/web-servers")

### Groups

Groups allow you to organize your connections hierarchically:
- Use `/` to create nested groups (e.g., "production/web-servers")
- Navigate through groups using arrow keys
- Press `Enter` to enter a group
- Use `..` to go back to parent group

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in `~/.ssh-manager/`:
- `config.json`: Encrypted connection database
- `.key`: Encryption key for the database

## Security

- All credentials are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Passwords are never displayed by default
- SSH keys are stored as file paths, not the actual keys
- Configuration files are stored with appropriate permissions
